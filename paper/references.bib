	abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding conﬁdence levels (CLs) in high contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly towards small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically aﬀects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at ﬁxed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases towards very small inner working angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be signiﬁcantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis which ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical eﬀect has a signiﬁcant impact on current coronagraphic and future high contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},

We study the close surroundings of the star (2 to 25 arcsec) by means of adaptive optics and coronographic device in the near-infrared, using the ESO/ADONIS system. The resulting high contrast images in the JHKs bands have a resolution of {\textasciitilde} 0.2 arcsec and limiting apparent magnitude ranging from mK = 9.5 at 3 arcsec, from Sirius-A to mK = 13.1 at 10 arcsec. These are the first and deepest images of the Sirius system in this infrared range. From these observations, accurate infrared photometry of the Sirius-B white dwarf companion is obtained. The JH magnitudes of Sirius-B are found to agree with expectations for a DA white dwarf of temperature (T=25000K) and gravity (log(g) = 8.5), consistent with the characteristics determined from optical observations. However, a small, significant excess is measurable for the K band, similar to that detected for "dusty" isolated white dwarfs harbouring suspected planetary debris. The possible existence of such circumstellar material around Sirius-B has still to be confirmed by further observations. These deep images allow us to search for small but yet undetected companions to Sirius. Apart from Sirius-B, no other source is detected within the total 25 arcsec field. The minimum detectable mass is around 10 MJup inside the planetary limit, indicating that an extrasolar planet at a projected distance of {\textasciitilde} 25 AU from Sirius would have been detected (abridged abstract).},

	abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an
altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor {\textasciitilde}5 for each image subtraction. The
combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5 σ contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 8". For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for
{\textasciitilde}1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.

	abstract = {Imaging circumstellar disks in the near-infrared provides unprecedented information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, current post-processing techniques for high-contrast imaging have a limited sensitivity to extended signals and their morphology is often plagued with strong morphological distortions. Moreover, it is challenging to disentangle planetary signals from the disk when the two components are closed or intertwined. We propose a pipeline that is capable of detecting a wide variety of disks and preserving their shapes and flux distributions. By construction, our approach separates planets from disks. After analyzing the distortions induced by the current angular differential imaging (ADI) post-processing techniques, we establish a direct model of the different components constituting a temporal sequence of high-contrast images. In an inverse problem framework, we jointly estimate the starlight residuals and the potential extended sources and point sources hidden in the images, using low-complexity priors for each signal. To verify and estimate the performance of our approach, we tested it on VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS data, in which we injected synthetic disks and planets. We also applied our approach on observations containing real disks. Our technique makes it possible to detect disks from ADI datasets of a contrast above \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ with respect to the host star. As no specific shape of the disks is assumed, we are capable of extracting a wide diversity of disks, including face-on disks. The intensity distribution of the detected disk is accurately preserved and point sources are distinguished, even close to the disk.},

	abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to 
reach a high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the
main limitation in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles
that are created by residual instrumental aberrations. They have the
same angular size as planetary companions and are often brighter, hence
hindering our capability to detect exoplanets. Dedicated observation
strategies and signal processing techniques are necessary to disentangle
these speckles from planetary signals. The output of these methods is a
detection map in which the value of each pixel is related to a
probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found
in the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is
Gaussian. However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates,
especially close to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of
detection map by analysing the speckle noise distribution, namely the
Modified Rician distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum
of random variables to show that the tail of the distribution of the
residual noise decays as an exponential distribution, hence explaining
the high false detection rate obtained with the Gaussian assumption.
From this analysis, we introduce a novel time domain detection map and
we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance of our approach
through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical rule to
determine detection threshold providing a good trade-off between true
positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.},

This paper presents the results of a multi epoch J band common proper motion survey of 23 nearby equatorial and Northern hemisphere white dwarfs. We rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions, with limiting masses determined from the completeness limit of each observation, to 18 white dwarfs. For the remaining five targets, the motion of the white dwarf is not sufficiently separated from the non-moving background objects in each field. These targets require additional observations to conclusively rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions.

We aim to exploit novel fast chopping techniques newly developed for astronomy with the aid of adaptive optics to look for thermal signatures of exoplanets around bright stars in the solar neighbourhood. We use the upgraded VISIR (Very Large Telescope Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed) instrument with high contrast imaging (HCI) capability optimized for observations at 10{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$m to look for exoplanets around five nearby (\$d\$ {\textless} 4 pc) stars. The instrument provides an improved signal-to-noise (S/N) by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 in the N-band compared to standard VISIR for a given S/N and time. In this work we achieve a detection sensitivity of sub-mJy, which is sufficient to detect few Jupiter mass planets in nearby systems. Although no detections are made we achieve most sensitive limits within \${\textless}2''\$ for all the observed targets compared to previous campaigns. For \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri we achieve detection limits very close to the giant planets discovered by RV, with the limits on \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A being the most sensitive to date. Our non-detection therefore supports an older age for \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A.

Combined with the parallax and the motion of the A component, these elements yield dynamical masses of 2.063+/- 0.023 \{M\}⊙ and 1.018+/- 0.011 \{M\}⊙ for Sirius A and B, respectively. Our precise HST astrometry rules out third bodies orbiting either star in the system, down to masses of ∼15-25 \{M\}\{Jup\}. The location of Sirius B in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is in excellent agreement with theoretical cooling tracks for WDs of its dynamical mass, and implies a cooling age of ∼126 Myr. The position of Sirius B on the mass-radius plane is also consistent with WD theory, assuming a carbon-oxygen core. Including the pre-WD evolutionary timescale of the assumed progenitor, the total age of Sirius B is about 228 ± 10 Myr. We calculated evolutionary tracks for stars with the dynamical mass of Sirius A, using two independent codes. We find it necessary to assume a slightly subsolar metallicity, of about 0.85 \{Z\}⊙ , to fit its location on the luminosity-radius plane. The age of Sirius A based on these models is about 237-247 Myr, with uncertainties of ±15 Myr, consistent with that of the WD companion. We discuss astrophysical puzzles presented by the Sirius system, including the probability that the two stars must have interacted in the past, even though there is no direct evidence for this and the orbital eccentricity remains high. Based in part on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	abstract = {A simple question of celestial mechanics is investigated: in what regions of phase space near a binary system can planets persist for long times? The planets are taken to be test particles moving in the field of an eccentric binary system. A range of values of the binary eccentricity and mass ratio is studied, and both the case of planets orbiting close to one of the stars, and that of planets outside the binary orbiting the system's center of mass, are examined. From the results, empirical expressions are developed for both (1) the largest orbit around each of the stars and (2) the smallest orbit around the binary system as a whole, in which test particles survive the length of the integration (10{\textasciicircum}4 binary periods). The empirical expressions developed, which are roughly linear in both the mass ratio mu and the binary eccentricity e, are determined for the range 0.0{\textless}=e{\textless}=0.7-0.8 and 0.1{\textless}=mu{\textless}=0.9 in both regions and can be used to guide searches for planets in binary systems. After considering the case of a single low-mass planet in binary systems, the stability of a mutually interacting system of planets orbiting one star of a binary system is examined, though in less detail.},

	abstract = {Evidence is building that remnants of solar systems might orbit a large percentage of white dwarfs, as the polluted atmospheres of DAZ and DBZ white dwarfs indicate the very recent accretion of metal-rich material. Some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have large mid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to be reservoirs for the metal accretion. These systems are coined DAZd white dwarfs. Here we investigate the claims of Bonnet-Bidaud \& Pantin that Sirius B, the nearest white dwarf to the Sun, might have an infrared excess from a dusty debris disk. Sirius B's companion, Sirius A, is commonly observed as a mid-infrared photometric standard in the Southern hemisphere. We combine several years of Gemini/T-ReCS photometric standard observations to produce deep mid-infrared imaging in five {\textasciitilde}10 μm filters (broad N + four narrow band), which reveal the presence of Sirius B. Our photometry is consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrain any mid-infrared excess to lsim10\% of the photosphere. Thus, we conclude that Sirius B does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in DAZd white dwarfs.

	abstract = {The ultimate fates of binary companions to stars (including whether the companion survives and the final orbit of the binary) are of interest in light of an increasing number of recently discovered, low-mass companions to white dwarfs (WDs). In this Letter, we study the evolution of a two-body system wherein the orbit adjusts due to structural changes in the primary, dissipation of orbital energy via tides, and mass-loss during the giant phases; previous studies have not incorporated changes in the primary's spin. For companions ranging from Jupiter's mass to ∼0.3 M☉ and primaries ranging from 1 to 3 M☉, we determine the minimum initial semimajor axis required for the companion to avoid engulfment by the primary during post-main-sequence evolution, and highlight the implications for the ultimate survival of the known exoplanets. We present regions in secondary mass and orbital period space where an engulfed companion might be expected to survive the common envelope phase (CEP), and compare with known M dwarf+WD short-period binaries. Finally, we note that engulfed Earth-like planets cannot survive a CEP. Detection of a first-generation terrestrial planet in the WD habitable zone requires scattering from a several au orbit to a high-eccentricity orbit (with a periastron of ∼R☉) from which it is damped into a circular orbit via tidal friction, possibly rendering it an uninhabitable, charred ember.},

Through this work, we have discovered a faint companion to the white dwarf WD 0806-661. The comoving source has a projected separation of 130'', corresponding to 2500 AU at the distance of the primary (19.2 pc). If it is physically associated, then its absolute magnitude at 4.5 μm is {\textasciitilde}1 mag fainter than the faintest known T dwarfs, making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf. The combination of M 4.5 and the age of the primary (1.5 Gyr) implies an effective temperature of {\textasciitilde}300 K and a mass of {\textasciitilde}7 M Jup according to theoretical evolutionary models. The white dwarf's progenitor likely had a mass of {\textasciitilde}2 M sun, and thus could have been born with a circumstellar disk that was sufficiently massive to produce a companion with this mass. Therefore, the companion could be either a brown dwarf that formed like a binary star or a giant planet that was born within a disk and has been dynamically scattered to a larger orbit.

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: {\textbackslash}beginlist {\textbackslash}item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. {\textbackslash}item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. {\textbackslash}item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. {\textbackslash}endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

	abstract = {We present significantly improved proper motion measurements of the Milky Way's central stellar cluster. These improvements are made possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion model for the W. M. Keck II 10 m telescope's adaptive optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 smaller compared with the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is {\textasciitilde}2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, or {\textasciitilde}3.4 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 8 kpc (1σ). Also, proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the GC.},

In the process, new stars within 20 pc have been added, a more uniform set of distance estimates as well as improved spectral and binary classifications are available. The present 25 pc sample is estimated to be about 68 per cent complete (the corresponding 20 pc sample is now 86 per cent complete). The space density of white dwarfs is unchanged at 4.8 ± 0.5 × 10-3 pc-3. This new study includes a white dwarf mass distribution and luminosity function based on the 232 stars in the 25 pc sample. We find a significant excess of single stars over systems containing one or more companions (74 per cent versus 26 per cent). This suggests mechanisms that result in the loss of companions during binary system evolution. In addition, this updated sample exhibits a pronounced deficiency of nearby `Sirius-like' systems. 11 such systems were found within the 20 pc volume versus only one additional system found in the volume between 20 and 25 pc. An estimate of white dwarf birth rates during the last ∼8 Gyr is derived from individual remnant cooling ages. A discussion of likely ways new members of the local sample may be found is provided.},

Very early on, the existence of a potential third body was put forward to explain some of the observed properties of the system. We present new coronagraphic observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE (Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch) that explore, for the very first time, the innermost regions of the system down to 0.2 arcsec(0.5 au) from Sirius A. Our observations cover the near-infrared from 0.95 to 2.3 μm and they offer the best on-sky contrast ever reached at these angular separations. After detailing the steps of our SPHERE/IRDIFS data analysis, we present a robust method to derive detection limits for multispectral data from high-contrast imagers and spectrographs. In terms of raw performance, we report contrasts of 14.3 mag at 0.2 arcsec, ˜16.3 mag in the 0.4-1.0 arcsec range and down to 19 mag at 3.7 arcsec. In physical units, our observations are sensitive to giant planets down to 11 MJup at 0.5 au, 6-7 MJup in the 1-2 au range and ˜4 MJup at 10 au. Despite the exceptional sensitivity of our observations, we do not report the detection of additional companions around Sirius A. Using a Monte Carlo orbital analysis, we show that we can reject, with about 50 per cent probability, the existence of an 8 MJup planet orbiting at 1 au.},

Here we present two epochs of high-contrast imaging observations performed with Subaru IRCS and AO188 in the 4.05 μm narrowband Br α filter. These data surpass previous observations by an order of magnitude in detectable companion mass, allowing us to probe the relevant separation range down to the planetary-mass regime (6-12 M Jup at 1'', 2-4 M Jup at 2'', and 1.6 M Jup beyond 4''). We complement these data with one epoch of M-band observations from MMT/AO Clio, which reach comparable performance. No data set reveals any companion candidates above the 5σ level, allowing us to refute the existence of Sirius C as suggested by the previous astrometric analysis. Furthermore, our Br α photometry of Sirius B confirms the lack of an infrared excess beyond the white dwarf's blackbody spectrum.

Jupiter, in particular, might end up more highly irradiated than the hot Neptune GJ 436b and, hence, could appropriately be termed a "hot Jupiter." When their stars go through the RGB or asymptotic giant branch stages, many of the currently known Jupiter-mass planets in several-AU orbits will receive levels of irradiation comparable to the hot Jupiters, which will transiently increase their atmospheric temperatures to {\textasciitilde}1000 K or more. Furthermore, massive planets around post-main-sequence stars could accrete a non-negligible amount of material from the enhanced stellar winds, thereby significantly altering their atmospheric chemistry as well as causing a significant accretion luminosity during the epochs of most intense stellar mass loss. Future generations of infrared observatories might be able to probe the thermal and chemical structure of such hot Jupiters' atmospheres. Finally, we argue that, unlike their main-sequence analogs (whose zonal winds are thought to be organized in only a few broad, planetary-scale jets), red-giant hot Jupiters should have multiple, narrow jets of zonal winds and efficient day-night redistribution.},

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the Karhunen-Loève image projection algorithm) using synthetic circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time.

	abstract = {We describe a Bayesian rejection-sampling algorithm designed to efficiently compute posterior distributions of orbital elements for data covering short fractions of long-period exoplanet orbits. Our implementation of this method, Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI), converges up to several orders of magnitude faster than two implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in this regime. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach by showing that OFTI calculates accurate posteriors for all existing astrometry of the exoplanet 51 Eri b up to 100 times faster than a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. We demonstrate the accuracy of OFTI by comparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various MCMC implementations, finding the output posteriors to be identical within shot noise. We also describe how our algorithm was used to successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future based on less than three months of astrometry. Finally, we apply OFTI to 10 long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs, all but one of which have been monitored over less than 3\% of their orbits, producing fits to their orbits from astrometric records in the literature.},

	abstract = {Context. Heavy metals in the atmospheres of white dwarfs are thought in many cases to be accreted from a circumstellar debris disk, which was formed by the tidal disruption of a rocky planetary body within the Roche radius of the star. The abundance analysis of photospheric elements and conclusions about the chemical composition of the accreted matter are a new and promising method of studying the composition of extrasolar planetary systems. However, ground-based searches for metal-polluted white dwarfs that rely primarily on the detection of the Ca ii K line become insensitive at T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 15 000 K because this ionization state depopulates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present the results of the first unbiased survey for metal pollution among hydrogen-atmosphere (DA type) white dwarfs with cooling ages in the range 20-200 Myr and 17 000 K \&lt;T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 27 000 K. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The sample was observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope in the far ultraviolet range between 1130 and 1435 Å. The atmospheric parameters were obtained using these spectra and optical observations from the literature. Element abundances were determined using theoretical models, which include the effects of element stratification due to gravitational settling and radiative levitation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find 48 of the 85 DA white dwarfs studied, or 56\% show traces of heavy elements. In 25 stars (showing only Si and occasionally C), the elements can be explained by radiative levitation alone, although we argue that accretion has very likely occurred recently. The remaining 23 white dwarfs (27\%), however, must be currently accreting. Together with previous studies from the ground and adopting bulk Earth abundances for the debris, accretion rates range from a few 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to a few 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, with no evident trend in cooling age from ≈40 Myr to ≈2 Gyr. Only a single, modest case of metal pollution (Ṁ \&lt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} g s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) is found among ten white dwarfs with T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 23 000 K, in excellent agreement with the absence of infrared excess from dust around these warmer stars. The median, main sequence progenitor of our sample corresponds to an A-type star of ≈2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and we find 13 of 23 white dwarfs descending from main sequence 2-3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, late B- and A-type stars to be currently accreting. Only one of 14 targets with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}wd{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 0.8 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is found to be currently accreting, which suggests a large fraction of these stars result from double-degenerate mergers, and the merger disks do not commonly reform large planetesimals or otherwise pollute the remnant. We reconfirm our previous finding that two 625 Myr Hyades white dwarfs are currently accreting rocky planetary debris. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: At least 27\% of all white dwarfs with cooling ages 20-200 Myr are accreting planetary debris, but that fraction could be as high as ≈50\%. At T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 23 000 K, the luminosity of white dwarfs is probably sufficient to vaporize circumstellar dust grains, so no stars with strong metal-pollution are found. Planetesimal disruption events should occur in this cooling age and temperature range as well, and they are likely to result in short phases of high mass-transfer rates. It appears that the formation of rocky planetary material is common around 2-3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} late B- and A-type stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Table 1 is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201423691/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We present evidence, based on atmospheric pollution by various elements heavier than helium, that a comparable fraction of the white dwarf descendants of such main-sequence stars are orbited by planetary systems. These systems have survived, at least in part, through all stages of stellar evolution that precede the white dwarf. During the time interval ({\textasciitilde}200 million years) that a typical polluted white dwarf in our sample has been cooling it has accreted from its planetary system the mass of one of the largest asteroids in our solar system (e.g., Vesta or Ceres). Usually, this accreted mass will be only a fraction of the total mass of rocky material that orbits these white dwarfs; for plausible planetary system configurations we estimate that this total mass is likely to be at least equal to that of the Sun's asteroid belt, and perhaps much larger. We report abundances of a suite of eight elements detected in the little studied star G241-6 that we find to be among the most heavily polluted of all moderately bright white dwarfs.},

	abstract = {We have completed a direct-imaging search for faint companions (FCs) to 23 stars within 13 pc of the Sun using the Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera. The strategy of this search changed considerably from that reported in 1996. To maximize the image contrast between potential FCs and a target star's point-spread function, we adopted the F1042M filter (λc{\textasciitilde}1.02 μm, Δλ{\textasciitilde}0.04 μm) as the primary bandpass of our search. Although our sensitivity to FCs varied with the brightness of and separation from our target stars, an ultimate 10 σ detection limit of m1042{\textasciitilde}18 within 17" of the fainter targets was achieved. As the end of the main sequence occurs at M1042{\textasciitilde}12, this detection limit makes our search for FCs to nearby stars the most sensitive yet published. Despite this great sensitivity, no previously undetected FCs were found. Our survey would have detected all stellar companions within 17" of our target stars, except for any lowest mass companions lying within 0.5"-1" of the brightest (V{\textless}1.5) targets. Applying recent models of brown dwarf spectra and evolution, we find that our search was sensitive to young (0.5 Gyr), low-mass (less than 10 MJ) brown dwarf companions to the fainter targets within 5 pc. A brown dwarf with mass 40 MJ and age 5 Gyr would have been detected at separations greater than 5" from Gl 559A (α Centauri A). Our search was not sensitive to 1 Gyr-old brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}5 MJ, nor was it sensitive to 5 Gyr-old brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 MJ. On the positive side, we show the first direct image of the triple system GJ 1245ABC in which all three components are well resolved. Multiband photometry of GJ 1245C suggests for that object a spectral type later than M7. The measured positions of GJ 1245AC are discordant with those expected from published photocentric-orbit elements. The observed positions of four other multiple systems (Gl 65AB, Gl 244AB, Gl 280AB, and Gl 866ABC) also differ from those expected from published orbital elements. The discrepancies noted for Gl 280AB are sufficient to resolve the long-standing inconsistency between Procyon's observed luminosity and that derived from the theoretical mass-luminosity relation. F1042M images of the astrometric binary Gl 105A do not reveal the presence of a fourth component, as has been proposed to reconcile the differences between the observed location of the M7 V companion Gl 105C and the predicted separations of the perturbing body from two independent astrometric studies.},

	abstract = {Planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star. However, an additional planetary formation route may exist in old evolved binary systems. In such systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where mass transferred from the expanding evolved star to its binary companion could form an accretion disk around it. Such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for, and/or interact with, the second generation planets, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions may serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including PSR B1620-26 (in a globular cluster), Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique configurations.},

The selection criteria to define the whole sample were tuned to cover the broad-band characteristics of known binary post-AGB stars. The whole sample includes 20 dusty RV Tauri stars from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS). We supplemented our own Geneva optical photometry with literature data to cover a broad range of fluxes from the UV to the far-IR.Results.All the SEDs display very similar characteristics: a large IR excess with a dust excess starting near the sublimation temperature, irrespective of the effective temperature of the central star. Moreover, when available, the long wavelength fluxes show a black-body slope indicative of the presence of a component of large mm sized grains.Conclusions.We argue that in all systems, gravitationally bound dusty discs are present. The discs must be puffed-up to cover a large opening angle for the central star and we argue that the discs have some similarity with the passive discs detected around young stellar objects. We interpret the presence of a disc to be a signature for binarity of the central object, but this will need confirmation by long-term monitoring of the radial velocities. We argue that dusty RV Tauri stars are those binaries which happen to be in the Population II instability strip.},

	abstract = {Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the Solar System1, most of which orbit stars that will eventually evolve into red giants and then into white dwarfs. During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will be engulfed by the star2, but more distant planets can survive this phase and remain in orbit around the white dwarf3,4. Some white dwarfs show evidence for rocky material floating in their atmospheres5, in warm debris disks6-9 or orbiting very closely10-12, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that were scattered inwards and tidally disrupted13. Recently, the discovery of a gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to that of ice giant planets14 demonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether these planets can survive the journey. So far, no intact planets have been detected in close orbits around white dwarfs. Here we report the observation of a giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4 days. We observed and modelled the periodic dimming of the white dwarf caused by the planet candidate passing in front of the star in its orbit. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more than 14 times as massive (with 95 per cent confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence of common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during the red giant phase and shrinks owing to friction. In this case, however, the long orbital period (compared with other white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions) and low mass of the planet candidate make common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, our findings for the WD 1856+534 system indicate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being tidally disrupted, motivating the search for smaller transiting planets around white dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Physical collisions and close approaches between stars play an important role in the formation of exotic stellar systems. Standard theories suggest that collisions are rare, occurring only via random encounters between stars in dense clusters. We present a different formation pathway, the triple evolution dynamical instability (TEDI), in which mass loss in an evolving triple star system causes orbital instability. The subsequent chaotic orbital evolution of the stars triggers close encounters, collisions, exchanges between the stellar components, and the dynamical formation of eccentric compact binaries (including Sirius-like binaries). We demonstrate that the rate of stellar collisions due to the TEDI is approximately 10-4 yr-1 per Milky Way Galaxy, which is nearly 30 times higher than the total collision rate due to random encounters in the Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, we find that the dominant type of stellar collision is qualitatively different; most collisions involve asymptotic giant branch stars, rather than main sequence or slightly evolved stars, which dominate collisions in globular clusters. The TEDI mechanism should lead us to revise our understanding of collisions and the formation of compact, eccentric binaries in the field.},

	abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} − G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}{\textless}A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia"{\textgreater}http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. A vortex coronagraph is now available for high contrast observations with the Keck/NIRC2 instrument at L band. The vortex coronagraph uses a vortex phase mask in a focal plane and a Lyot stop in a downstream pupil plane to provide high contrast at small angular separations from the observed host star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Reaching the optimal performance of the coronagraph requires fine control of the wavefront incident on the phase mask. In particular, centering errors can lead to significant stellar light leakage that degrades the contrast performance and prevents the observation of faint planetary companions around the observed stars. It is thus critical to correct for the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center, generally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity field variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil tracking mode. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex coronagraph has been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument. This algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center, and stabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: On-sky data show that the QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4 mas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator is probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot stop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5 mas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust method to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition, QACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the observing efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used for vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and angular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.},

Atmosphere models are generated with our state-of-the-art 1D radiative-convective equilibrium code ATMO, and are used as surface boundary conditions to calculate the interior structure and evolution of 0.001-0.075 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} objects. Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by {\textasciitilde}1-2\% at the stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams, highlighting how the 3.5-5.5 μm flux window can be used to calibrate vertical mixing in cool T-Y spectral type objects.},

	abstract = {We present the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) based on the self-consistent analysis of Sirius B and 79 white dwarfs from 13 star clusters. We have also acquired additional signal on eight white dwarfs previously analyzed in the NGC 2099 cluster field, four of which are consistent with membership. These re-observed white dwarfs have masses ranging from 0.72 to 0.97 M ⊙, with initial masses from 3.0 to 3.65 M ⊙, where the IFMR has an important change in slope that these new data help to observationally confirm. In total, this directly measured IFMR has small scatter (σ = 0.06 M ⊙) and spans from progenitors of 0.85 to 7.5 M ⊙. Applying two different stellar evolutionary models to infer two different sets of white dwarf progenitor masses shows that, when the same model is also used to derive the cluster ages, the resulting IFMR has weak sensitivity to the adopted model at all but the highest initial masses ({\textgreater}5.5 M ⊙). The nonlinearity of the IFMR is also clearly observed with moderate slopes at lower masses (0.08 M final/M initial) and higher masses (0.11 M final/M initial) that are broken up by a steep slope (0.19 M final/M initial) between progenitors from 2.85 to 3.6 M ⊙. This IFMR shows total stellar mass loss ranges from 33\% of M initial at 0.83 M ⊙ to 83\% of M initial at 7.5 M ⊙. Testing this total mass loss for dependence on progenitor metallicity, however, finds no detectable sensitivity across the moderate range of -0.15 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} +0.15.

Binary stellar evolution in such systems influences the dynamical evolution of the resident planets. Here, we study the evolution of a single planet orbiting one star in an evolving binary system. We find that stellar evolution can trigger dynamical instabilities that drive planets into chaotic orbits. This instability leads to planet-star collisions, exchange of the planet between the binary stars ("star hoppers"), and ejection of the planet from the system. The means by which planets can be recaptured is similar to the pull-down capture mechanism for irregular solar system satellites. Because planets often suffer close encounters with the primary on the asymptotic giant branch, captures during a collision with the stellar envelope are also possible for more massive planets. Such capture could populate the habitable zone around white dwarfs.},

@misc{marleySonoraBobcatCloudfree2021,
	title = {Sonora {Bobcat}: cloud-free, substellar atmosphere models, spectra, photometry, evolution, and chemistry},
	shorttitle = {Sonora {Bobcat}},
	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/5063476},
	abstract = {OVERVIEW Presented here are models for non-irradiated, substellar mass objects belonging to the Sonora model series, described in Marley et al. (2021). The files presented here are model temperature-pressure structures ("structure"), emergent spectra from the top of the atmosphere ("spectra"), thermal evolution and photometry ("evolution\_and\_photometry"), and rainout chemical equilibrium tables used to compute the models ("chemistry").  Atmospheric structure and spectra .tar file names specify metallicity [M/H] and carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) relative to solar. For example, "structures+0.0\_co1.5.tar.gz" contains the set of radiative-convective equilibrium atmospheric structures for solar metallicity ("+0.0") with C/O=1.5 times the solar abundance. The \_co*.* is omitted for solar C/O, or co\_1.0. The individual file naming convention is described below. All stated abundances and ratios are relative to Lodders (2010) abundances, see Marley et al. (2021) for details and use caution when referring to other abundance tabulations. This particular set of model atmosphere structures and associated spectra, photometry, and evolution, which we name Sonora Bobcat, are for cloudless objects with 3.25 ≤ log g (cgs) ≤ 5.5 and 200 ≤ Teff ≤ 2400K. Steps in Teff vary from 25K to 1000K and steps in log g are 0.25 or 0.5. Some combinations of model grid parameters include additional values of the gravity.  Models are provided for [M/H] = -0.5, 0.0, and +0.5 and "rainout" chemical equilibrium. A limited set of models with carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 0.5 and 1.5 times solar abundance are also included. For the convenience of having a rectangular table in (Teff, gravity) space, models are calculated in regimes that are not reached by the evolution, such as very high gravity and very low Teff. Refer to the companion evolution tables to identify combinations of Teff and log g outside the bounds covered by the evolution. ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE Atmospheric structure and spectra filenames specify Teff and gravity (in mks units) along with [M/H] and (C/O) relative to solar. "co1.5" in version and spectra header nomenclature refers to 1.5 times the solar C/O ratio. \_co*.* is generally omitted for 1.0, the solar value. For example, the file t1000g316nc\_m-0.5.dat contains the structure of a model with  Teff=1000K, g=316m/s2 (the exact value of the gravity is given in the first line of the file, see below) , [Fe/H]=-0.5, and C/O=1.0 times the solar value.  Temperature structure and spectra files have a one line header giving "Teff, grav(MKS), Y, f\_sed, kz\_min, [Fe/H], C/O, f\_hole". Teff and grav are the effective temperature (K) and gravity (MKS), Y is the He mass fraction. f\_sed is a cloud parameterization which is not relevant for these cloudless models and is arbitrarily given as 0.0. Likewise kz\_min relates to the atmospheric eddy diffusion coefficient, which is also not relevant for these chemical equilibrium models and is arbitrarily set equal to a placeholder value that is not used in these models. [Fe/H] and C/O are the metallicity and C/O ratios as described above. [Fe/H] is identical to [M/H]. f\_hole is another cloud parameter for cloudy models, not relevant to these cloudless models. Columns in the atmosphere structure files describe the atmosphere at discrete levels. Columns give: level index, P(bar), T(K), internally used check parameter, adiabatic temperature gradient (d ln T / d ln P), local temperature gradient (d ln T / d ln P), atmospheric density (g / cm3). EVOLUTION AND PHOTOMETRY Evolution and Photometry tables are described in detail in a README file included in that tar file. Evolution files connect mass, effective temperature, radius, age, gravity, and moment of inertia for these model sets. Each set of model spectra is complemented with tables of fluxes and of absolute magnitudes in a number of photometric systems commonly used in brown dwarf and exoplanet research (MKO, Keck, 2MASS, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer IRAC, etc).  Fluxes and magnitudes for the full set of JWST filters is also included in separate tables.  Magnitudes are computed on the Vega system (using the Vega spectrum of Bohlin \& Gilliland 2004) or on the AB system (e.g. for SDSS). SPECTRA The model spectra each contain close to 362000 wavelength points. The resolving power varies with wavelength and ranges from R=6000 to 200000 but is otherwise the same for all spectra. The first line gives the model parameters in the same format as the structure files described above. This is followed by the spectrum Column 1: wavelength in µm Column 2:  Eddington flux Fν in erg/cm2/s/Hz (exercise caution with factors of {\textbackslash}(4{\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}) when comparing to the radiation flux, e.g., see Section 3.3 of Hubeny \& Mihalas, "Theory of Stellar Atmospheres") The spectral fluxes are given at the top of the atmosphere and are strictly monochromatic. The model spectrum provides no information in the wavelength range between two tabulated points. Unless a spectral line or feature is well resolved, interpolation in wavelength is not advised.  For comparison with data, the model spectra need to be convolved and binned to the instrumental resolution and sampling. In our experience, a minimum of 10 wavelength points is necessary to obtain a reasonable average flux over a wavelength interval. This is a rule of thumb and caution is advised, especially when comparing with high resolution data. The flux received at Earth is that given in the table scaled by (R/D)2  where R is the radius of the object (given in the companion evolution tables) and D its distance.  The solar spectra and photometry are the same as those archived at https://zenodo.org/record/1309035\#.YOyz4S1h2X0, which did not provide the T(P) profiles available here. CHEMISTRY We also separately include rainout chemical equilibrium tables for these same atmospheric bulk abundances. These chemistry files are described in detail by their own README file. Additional chemistry tables, beyond those used for the models presented here, are also included for completeness. Users interested in the chemical abundances of the structure models must interpolate within the matching chemistry file for the atmospheric species of interest.

	abstract = {The search for planets around white dwarf stars, and evidence for dynamical instability around them in the form of atmospheric pollution and circumstellar disks, raises questions about the nature of planetary systems that can survive the vicissitudes of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We study the competing effects, on planets at several AU from the star, of strong tidal forces arising from the star's large convective envelope, and of the planets' orbital expansion due to stellar mass loss. We study, for the first time, the evolution of planets while following each thermal pulse on the AGB. For Jovian planets, tidal forces are strong, and can pull into the envelope planets initially at {\textasciitilde}3 AU for a 1 M ⊙ star and {\textasciitilde}5 AU for a 5 M ⊙ star. Lower-mass planets feel weaker tidal forces, and terrestrial planets initially within 1.5-3 AU enter the stellar envelope. Thus, low-mass planets that begin inside the maximum stellar radius can survive, as their orbits expand due to mass loss. The inclusion of a moderate planetary eccentricity slightly strengthens the tidal forces experienced by Jovian planets. Eccentric terrestrial planets are more at risk, since their eccentricity does not decay and their small pericenter takes them inside the stellar envelope. We also find the closest radii at which planets will be found around white dwarfs, assuming that any planet entering the stellar envelope is destroyed. Planets are in that case unlikely to be found inside {\textasciitilde}1.5 AU of a white dwarf with a 1 M ⊙ progenitor and {\textasciitilde}10 AU of a white dwarf with a 5 M ⊙ progenitor.},

	abstract = {Exo-planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star. However, additional planetary formation and evolution routes may exist in old evolved binary systems. Here we discuss the implications of binary stellar evolution on planetary systems in such environments. In these binary systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where mass is lost from one star and could be transferred to its binary companion, and may form an accretion disk around it. This raises the possibility that such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a new, second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems would be dynamically effected by the mass loss in the systems and may also interact with the newly formed disk. Such planets and/or planetesimals may also serve as seeds for the formation of the second generation planets, and/or interact with them, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of exo-planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions could possibly serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique configurations.},

Simulations predict9–11 that planets in Jupiter-like orbits around stars of ≲8 M☉ (solar mass) avoid being destroyed by the strong tidal forces of their stellar host, but as yet, there has been no observational confirmation of such a survivor. Here we report the non-detection of a main-sequence lens star in the microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-477Lb12 using near-infrared observations from the Keck Observatory. We determine that this system contains a 0.53 ± 0.11 M☉ white-dwarf host orbited by a 1.4 ± 0.3 Jupiter-mass planet with a separation on the plane of the sky of 2.8 ± 0.5 astronomical units, which implies a semi-major axis larger than this. This system is evidence that planets around white dwarfs can survive the giant and asymptotic giant phases of their host’s evolution, and supports the prediction that more than half of white dwarfs have Jovian planetary companions13. Located at approximately 2.0 kiloparsecs towards the centre of our Galaxy, it is likely to represent an analogue to the end stages of the Sun and Jupiter in our own Solar System.},

	abstract = {Gas-giant planets that form via core accretion might have very different characteristics from those that form via disk instability. Disk-instability objects are typically thought to have higher entropies, larger radii, and (generally) higher effective temperatures than core-accretion objects. In this paper, we provide a large set of models exploring the observational consequences of high-entropy (hot) and low-entropy (cold) initial conditions, in the hope that this will ultimately help to distinguish between different physical mechanisms of planet formation. However, the exact entropies and radii of newly formed planets due to these two modes of formation cannot, at present, be precisely predicted. It is possible that the distribution of properties of core-accretion-formed planets and the distribution of properties of disk-instability-formed planets overlap. We, therefore, introduce a broad range of "warm-start" gas-giant planet models. Between the hottest and the coldest models that we consider, differences in radii, temperatures, luminosities, and spectra persist for only a few million to a few tens of millions of years for planets that are a few times Jupiter's mass or less. For planets that are {\textasciitilde}five times Jupiter's mass or more, significant differences between hottest-start and coldest-start models persist for on the order of 100 Myr. We find that out of the standard infrared bands (J, H, K, L', M, N) the K and H bands are the most diagnostic of the initial conditions. A hottest-start model can be from {\textasciitilde}4.5 mag brighter (at Jupiter's mass) to {\textasciitilde}9 mag brighter (at 10 times Jupiter's mass) than a coldest-start model in the first few million years. In more massive objects, these large differences in luminosity and spectrum persist for much longer than in less massive objects. Finally, we consider the influence of atmospheric conditions on spectra, and find that the presence or absence of clouds, and the metallicity of an atmosphere, can affect an object's apparent brightness in different bands by up to several magnitudes.},

	abstract = {Context: Many binary stellar systems in which the primary star is beyond the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutionary phase show significant orbital eccentricities, whereas current binary interaction models predict that their orbits are circularised. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: In the search for a mechanism to counteract the circularising effect of tidal interaction, we analyse how the orbital parameters in a system are modified under mass loss and mass exchange among its binary components. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We propose a model for enhanced mass loss from the AGB star due to tidal interaction with its companion, which allows a smooth transition between the wind and Roche-lobe overflow mass loss regimes. We explicitly follow its effect along the orbit on the change in eccentricity and orbital semi-major axis, as well as the effect of accretion by the companion. We calculate timescales for the variation in these orbital parameters and compare them to the tidal circularisation timescale. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We find that in many cases, due to the enhanced mass loss of the AGB component at orbital phases closer to the periastron, the net eccentricity growth rate in one orbit is comparable to the rate of tidal circularisation. We show that with this eccentricity-enhancing mechanism it is possible to reproduce the orbital period and eccentricity of the Sirius system, which is expected to be circularised under the standard assumptions of binary interaction. We also show that this mechanism may provide an explanation for the eccentricities of most barium star systems, which are expected to be circularised due to tidal dissipation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: By proposing a tidally enhanced model of mass loss from AGB stars, we find a mechanism that efficiently works against the tidal circularisation of the orbit. This mechanism can explain the significant eccentricities observed in binary systems containing a white dwarf and a less evolved companion, which are predicted to be circularised due to their proximity, such as Sirius and systems with barium stars.},

	abstract = {With an aim of getting information on the equatorial rotation velocity (ve) of Sirius A separated from the inclination effect (sin-=i), a detailed profile analysis based on the Fourier transform technique was carried out for a large number of spectral lines, while explicitly taking into account the line-by-line differences in the centre-limb behaviours and the gravity darkening effect (which depend on the physical properties of each line) based on model calculations. The simulations showed that how the first-zero frequencies (q1) of Fourier transform amplitudes depends on ve is essentially determined by the temperature-sensitivity parameter (K) differing from line to line, and that Fe-=I lines (especially those of very weak ones) are more sensitive to ve than Fe-=II lines. The following conclusions were drawn by comparing the theoretical and observed q1 values for many Fe-=I and Fe-=II lines: (1) The projected rotational velocity (vesin-=i) for Sirius A is fairly well established at 16.3(±0.1) km s-1 by requiring that both Fe-=I and Fe-=II lines yield consistent results. (2) Although precise separation of ve and i is difficult, ve is concluded to be in the range of \$16 {\textbackslash}le v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\} {\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 30-40 km s-1, which corresponds to \$25{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \} {\textbackslash}lesssim i {\textbackslash}le 90{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$ . Accordingly, Sirius A is an intrinsically slow rotator for an A-type star, being consistent with its surface chemical peculiarity.},

	abstract = {The presence of planets around solar-type stars suggests that many white dwarfs should have relic planetary systems. While planets closer than {\textasciitilde}5 AU will most likely not survive the post-main-sequence lifetime of their parent star, any planet with semimajor axis greater than 5 AU will survive, and its semimajor axis will increase as the central star loses mass. Since the stability of adjacent orbits to mutual planet-planet perturbations depends on the ratio of the planet mass to the central star's mass, some planets in previously stable orbits around a star undergoing mass loss will become unstable. We show that when mass loss is slow, systems of two planets that are marginally stable can become unstable to close encounters, while for three planets the timescale for close approaches decreases significantly with increasing mass ratio. These processes could explain the presence of anomalous IR excesses around white dwarfs that cannot be explained by close companions, such as G29-38, and may also be an important factor in explaining the existence of DAZ white dwarfs. The onset of instability through changing mass ratios will also be a significant effect for planetary embryos gaining mass in protoplanetary disks.},

	abstract = {Traditional thermal evolution models of giant planets employ arbitrary initial conditions selected more for computational expediency than physical accuracy. Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving planet, this approach is valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To explore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets, we have employed model planets created by one implementation of the core-accretion mechanism as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. The luminosities and early cooling rates of young planets are highly sensitive to their internal entropies, which depend on the formation mechanism and are highly model dependent. As a result of the accretion shock through which most of the planetary mass is processed, we find lower initial internal entropies than commonly assumed in published evolution tracks. Consequently, young Jovian planets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than predicted by earlier models. Furthermore, the time interval during which the young Jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter mass planets (1MJ) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little at 20 million years, but 10MJ planets can take up to 1 billion years to match commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core-accretion mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the accretion shock, are correct and if extrasolar Jovian planets indeed form with low entropy, then young Jovian planets are substantially fainter at young ages than currently believed. Furthermore, early evolution tracks should be regarded as uncertain for much longer than the commonly quoted 106 yr. These results have important consequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young Jovian planets based on observed luminosities.},

	abstract = {Context. The abundances of elements in the atmosphere of an individual star provide a very broad range of extremely important information about the formation and evolution history of that star. Specifically, during the main sequence phase, the abundance pattern observed can provide valuable constraints on a range of hydrodynamical processes occurring beneath the visible atmosphere. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Among middle main sequence (A and B) stars, it is unusual to have abundance determinations for more than about a dozen of the 30 lightest chemical elements, largely because many elements do not have usefully strong spectral lines in the visible wavelength window usually used for abundance analysis. Exceptionally, for the bright, sharp-lined hot Am star Sirius A = HD 48915, high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio observations of the spectrum are available from 1265 Å to about 1 μm. The aim of this project is to determine generally how useful the UV part of the spectrum is for "generic" abundance determination in A stars, and which abundances of light and iron peak elements can be determined or improved for Sirius A using this nearly unique data set. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The UV and visible spectrum of Sirius A has been searched for useful spectral lines of all elements up to nickel (2 ≤ Z ≤ 28), as well as the heavy elements Sr, Y, Zr and Ba. Using the spectrum synthesis code ZEEMAN, abundances or upper limits are derived. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Abundances relative to H have been determined for a total of 20 elements, and upper limits are found for 4 others. Useful measurements or limits are possible from these data for all but three of the elements through Ni. In particular, it is found that the light element B is underabundant relative to the Sun by a factor of at least 30. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Recent computations have led to predictions of the abundance pattern of almost all the elements having Z ≤ 28 expected in the atmosphere of Sirius as a result of competition between (1) gravitationally and radiatively driven diffusion and either (2) turbulent mixing or (3) homogeneous mass loss. Comparison of these predictions with observations has been hampered by the limited number of elements for which accurate abundance determinations are available. The work presented here increases the number of elements for which reasonably well-determined abundances are available, and establishes more clearly the uncertainty of the abundance values for most of the elements up to Ni. The new data provide useful tests of the theoretical predictions of the consequences of atomic diffusion in slowly rotating A stars, and in some cases contradict them. These data may also provide some fresh insight into the evolution of the Sirius system. It appears that the new abundance values may be qualitatively consistent with the possibility that significant mass transfer has occurred between the two components of the system during its evolution.},
