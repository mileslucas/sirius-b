	abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding conﬁdence levels (CLs) in high contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly towards small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically aﬀects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at ﬁxed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases towards very small inner working angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be signiﬁcantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis which ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical eﬀect has a signiﬁcant impact on current coronagraphic and future high contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},

We study the close surroundings of the star (2 to 25 arcsec) by means of adaptive optics and coronographic device in the near-infrared, using the ESO/ADONIS system. The resulting high contrast images in the JHKs bands have a resolution of {\textasciitilde} 0.2 arcsec and limiting apparent magnitude ranging from mK = 9.5 at 3 arcsec, from Sirius-A to mK = 13.1 at 10 arcsec. These are the first and deepest images of the Sirius system in this infrared range. From these observations, accurate infrared photometry of the Sirius-B white dwarf companion is obtained. The JH magnitudes of Sirius-B are found to agree with expectations for a DA white dwarf of temperature (T=25000K) and gravity (log(g) = 8.5), consistent with the characteristics determined from optical observations. However, a small, significant excess is measurable for the K band, similar to that detected for "dusty" isolated white dwarfs harbouring suspected planetary debris. The possible existence of such circumstellar material around Sirius-B has still to be confirmed by further observations. These deep images allow us to search for small but yet undetected companions to Sirius. Apart from Sirius-B, no other source is detected within the total 25 arcsec field. The minimum detectable mass is around 10 MJup inside the planetary limit, indicating that an extrasolar planet at a projected distance of {\textasciitilde} 25 AU from Sirius would have been detected (abridged abstract).},

	abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an
altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor {\textasciitilde}5 for each image subtraction. The
combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5 σ contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 8". For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for
{\textasciitilde}1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.

	abstract = {Imaging circumstellar disks in the near-infrared provides unprecedented information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, current post-processing techniques for high-contrast imaging have a limited sensitivity to extended signals and their morphology is often plagued with strong morphological distortions. Moreover, it is challenging to disentangle planetary signals from the disk when the two components are closed or intertwined. We propose a pipeline that is capable of detecting a wide variety of disks and preserving their shapes and flux distributions. By construction, our approach separates planets from disks. After analyzing the distortions induced by the current angular differential imaging (ADI) post-processing techniques, we establish a direct model of the different components constituting a temporal sequence of high-contrast images. In an inverse problem framework, we jointly estimate the starlight residuals and the potential extended sources and point sources hidden in the images, using low-complexity priors for each signal. To verify and estimate the performance of our approach, we tested it on VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS data, in which we injected synthetic disks and planets. We also applied our approach on observations containing real disks. Our technique makes it possible to detect disks from ADI datasets of a contrast above \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ with respect to the host star. As no specific shape of the disks is assumed, we are capable of extracting a wide diversity of disks, including face-on disks. The intensity distribution of the detected disk is accurately preserved and point sources are distinguished, even close to the disk.},

	abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to 
reach a high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the
main limitation in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles
that are created by residual instrumental aberrations. They have the
same angular size as planetary companions and are often brighter, hence
hindering our capability to detect exoplanets. Dedicated observation
strategies and signal processing techniques are necessary to disentangle
these speckles from planetary signals. The output of these methods is a
detection map in which the value of each pixel is related to a
probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found
in the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is
Gaussian. However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates,
especially close to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of
detection map by analysing the speckle noise distribution, namely the
Modified Rician distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum
of random variables to show that the tail of the distribution of the
residual noise decays as an exponential distribution, hence explaining
the high false detection rate obtained with the Gaussian assumption.
From this analysis, we introduce a novel time domain detection map and
we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance of our approach
through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical rule to
determine detection threshold providing a good trade-off between true
positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.},

This paper presents the results of a multi epoch J band common proper motion survey of 23 nearby equatorial and Northern hemisphere white dwarfs. We rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions, with limiting masses determined from the completeness limit of each observation, to 18 white dwarfs. For the remaining five targets, the motion of the white dwarf is not sufficiently separated from the non-moving background objects in each field. These targets require additional observations to conclusively rule out the presence of any common proper motion companions.

We aim to exploit novel fast chopping techniques newly developed for astronomy with the aid of adaptive optics to look for thermal signatures of exoplanets around bright stars in the solar neighbourhood. We use the upgraded VISIR (Very Large Telescope Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed) instrument with high contrast imaging (HCI) capability optimized for observations at 10{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$m to look for exoplanets around five nearby (\$d\$ {\textless} 4 pc) stars. The instrument provides an improved signal-to-noise (S/N) by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 in the N-band compared to standard VISIR for a given S/N and time. In this work we achieve a detection sensitivity of sub-mJy, which is sufficient to detect few Jupiter mass planets in nearby systems. Although no detections are made we achieve most sensitive limits within \${\textless}2''\$ for all the observed targets compared to previous campaigns. For \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri we achieve detection limits very close to the giant planets discovered by RV, with the limits on \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Indi A being the most sensitive to date.

Combined with the parallax and the motion of the A component, these elements yield dynamical masses of 2.063+/- 0.023 \{M\}⊙ and 1.018+/- 0.011 \{M\}⊙ for Sirius A and B, respectively. Our precise HST astrometry rules out third bodies orbiting either star in the system, down to masses of ∼15-25 \{M\}\{Jup\}. The location of Sirius B in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is in excellent agreement with theoretical cooling tracks for WDs of its dynamical mass, and implies a cooling age of ∼126 Myr. The position of Sirius B on the mass-radius plane is also consistent with WD theory, assuming a carbon-oxygen core. Including the pre-WD evolutionary timescale of the assumed progenitor, the total age of Sirius B is about 228 ± 10 Myr. We calculated evolutionary tracks for stars with the dynamical mass of Sirius A, using two independent codes. We find it necessary to assume a slightly subsolar metallicity, of about 0.85 \{Z\}⊙ , to fit its location on the luminosity-radius plane. The age of Sirius A based on these models is about 237-247 Myr, with uncertainties of ±15 Myr, consistent with that of the WD companion. We discuss astrophysical puzzles presented by the Sirius system, including the probability that the two stars must have interacted in the past, even though there is no direct evidence for this and the orbital eccentricity remains high. Based in part on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

The planets are taken to be test particles moving in the field of an eccentric binary system. A range of values of the binary eccentricity and mass ratio is studied, and both the case of planets orbiting close to one of the stars, and that of planets outside the binary orbiting the system's center of mass, are examined. From the results, empirical expressions are developed for both (1) the largest orbit around each of the stars and (2) the smallest orbit around the binary system as a whole, in which test particles survive the length of the integration (10{\textasciicircum}4 binary periods). The empirical expressions developed, which are roughly linear in both the mass ratio mu and the binary eccentricity e, are determined for the range 0.0{\textless}=e{\textless}=0.7-0.8 and 0.1{\textless}=mu{\textless}=0.9 in both regions and can be used to guide searches for planets in binary systems. After considering the case of a single low-mass planet in binary systems, the stability of a mutually interacting system of planets orbiting one star of a binary system is examined, though in less detail.},

	abstract = {Evidence is building that remnants of solar systems might orbit a large percentage of white dwarfs, as the polluted atmospheres of DAZ and DBZ white dwarfs indicate the very recent accretion of metal-rich material. Some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have large mid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to be reservoirs for the metal accretion. These systems are coined DAZd white dwarfs. Here we investigate the claims of Bonnet-Bidaud \& Pantin that Sirius B, the nearest white dwarf to the Sun, might have an infrared excess from a dusty debris disk. Sirius B's companion, Sirius A, is commonly observed as a mid-infrared photometric standard in the Southern hemisphere. We combine several years of Gemini/T-ReCS photometric standard observations to produce deep mid-infrared imaging in five {\textasciitilde}10 μm filters (broad N + four narrow band), which reveal the presence of Sirius B. Our photometry is consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrain any mid-infrared excess to lsim10\% of the photosphere. Thus, we conclude that Sirius B does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in DAZd white dwarfs.

	abstract = {The ultimate fates of binary companions to stars (including whether the companion survives and the final orbit of the binary) are of interest in light of an increasing number of recently discovered, low-mass companions to white dwarfs (WDs). In this Letter, we study the evolution of a two-body system wherein the orbit adjusts due to structural changes in the primary, dissipation of orbital energy via tides, and mass-loss during the giant phases; previous studies have not incorporated changes in the primary's spin. For companions ranging from Jupiter's mass to ∼0.3 M☉ and primaries ranging from 1 to 3 M☉, we determine the minimum initial semimajor axis required for the companion to avoid engulfment by the primary during post-main-sequence evolution, and highlight the implications for the ultimate survival of the known exoplanets. We present regions in secondary mass and orbital period space where an engulfed companion might be expected to survive the common envelope phase (CEP), and compare with known M dwarf+WD short-period binaries. Finally, we note that engulfed Earth-like planets cannot survive a CEP. Detection of a first-generation terrestrial planet in the WD habitable zone requires scattering from a several au orbit to a high-eccentricity orbit (with a periastron of ∼R☉) from which it is damped into a circular orbit via tidal friction, possibly rendering it an uninhabitable, charred ember.},

Through this work, we have discovered a faint companion to the white dwarf WD 0806-661. The comoving source has a projected separation of 130'', corresponding to 2500 AU at the distance of the primary (19.2 pc). If it is physically associated, then its absolute magnitude at 4.5 μm is {\textasciitilde}1 mag fainter than the faintest known T dwarfs, making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf. The combination of M 4.5 and the age of the primary (1.5 Gyr) implies an effective temperature of {\textasciitilde}300 K and a mass of {\textasciitilde}7 M Jup according to theoretical evolutionary models. The white dwarf's progenitor likely had a mass of {\textasciitilde}2 M sun, and thus could have been born with a circumstellar disk that was sufficiently massive to produce a companion with this mass. Therefore, the companion could be either a brown dwarf that formed like a binary star or a giant planet that was born within a disk and has been dynamically scattered to a larger orbit.

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: {\textbackslash}beginlist {\textbackslash}item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. {\textbackslash}item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. {\textbackslash}item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. {\textbackslash}endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

	abstract = {We present significantly improved proper motion measurements of the Milky Way's central stellar cluster. These improvements are made possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion model for the W. M. Keck II 10 m telescope's adaptive optics camera (NIRC2) in its narrow field mode. For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 smaller compared with the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is {\textasciitilde}2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, or {\textasciitilde}3.4 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 8 kpc (1σ). Also, proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} arcsec{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the GC.},

Very early on, the existence of a potential third body was put forward to explain some of the observed properties of the system. We present new coronagraphic observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE (Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch) that explore, for the very first time, the innermost regions of the system down to 0.2 arcsec(0.5 au) from Sirius A. Our observations cover the near-infrared from 0.95 to 2.3 μm and they offer the best on-sky contrast ever reached at these angular separations. After detailing the steps of our SPHERE/IRDIFS data analysis, we present a robust method to derive detection limits for multispectral data from high-contrast imagers and spectrographs. In terms of raw performance, we report contrasts of 14.3 mag at 0.2 arcsec, ˜16.3 mag in the 0.4-1.0 arcsec range and down to 19 mag at 3.7 arcsec. In physical units, our observations are sensitive to giant planets down to 11 MJup at 0.5 au, 6-7 MJup in the 1-2 au range and ˜4 MJup at 10 au. Despite the exceptional sensitivity of our observations, we do not report the detection of additional companions around Sirius A. Using a Monte Carlo orbital analysis, we show that we can reject, with about 50 per cent probability, the existence of an 8 MJup planet orbiting at 1 au.},

	abstract = {Infrared excesses around metal-polluted white dwarfs have been associated with the accretion of dusty planetary material. This work analyses the available infrared data for an unbiased sample of white dwarfs and demonstrates that no more than 3.3 per cent can have a wide, flat, opaque dust disc, extending to the Roche radius, with a temperature at the disc inner edge of Tin = 1400 K, the standard model for the observed excesses. This is in stark contrast to the incidence of pollution of about 30 per cent. We present four potential reasons for the absence of an infrared excess in polluted white dwarfs, depending on their stellar properties and inferred accretion rates: (I) their dust discs are opaque, but narrow, thus evading detection if more than 85 per cent of polluted white dwarfs have dust discs narrower than δr {\textless} 0.04r, (II) their dust discs have been fully consumed, which only works for the oldest white dwarfs with sinking time-scales longer than hundreds of years, (III) their dust is optically thin, which can supply low accretion rates of {\textless}107 gs-1 if dominated by (Poynting-Robertson) PR-drag, and higher accretion rates, if inwards transport of material is enhanced, e.g. due to the presence of gas, (IV) their accretion is supplied by a pure gas disc, which could result from the sublimation of optically thin dust for T* {\textgreater} 20 000 K. Future observations sensitive to faint infrared excesses or the presence of gas can test the scenarios presented here, thereby better constraining the nature of the material fuelling accretion in polluted white dwarfs.},

Here we present two epochs of high-contrast imaging observations performed with Subaru IRCS and AO188 in the 4.05 μm narrowband Br α filter. These data surpass previous observations by an order of magnitude in detectable companion mass, allowing us to probe the relevant separation range down to the planetary-mass regime (6-12 M Jup at 1'', 2-4 M Jup at 2'', and 1.6 M Jup beyond 4''). We complement these data with one epoch of M-band observations from MMT/AO Clio, which reach comparable performance. No data set reveals any companion candidates above the 5σ level, allowing us to refute the existence of Sirius C as suggested by the previous astrometric analysis. Furthermore, our Br α photometry of Sirius B confirms the lack of an infrared excess beyond the white dwarf's blackbody spectrum.

Jupiter, in particular, might end up more highly irradiated than the hot Neptune GJ 436b and, hence, could appropriately be termed a "hot Jupiter." When their stars go through the RGB or asymptotic giant branch stages, many of the currently known Jupiter-mass planets in several-AU orbits will receive levels of irradiation comparable to the hot Jupiters, which will transiently increase their atmospheric temperatures to {\textasciitilde}1000 K or more. Furthermore, massive planets around post-main-sequence stars could accrete a non-negligible amount of material from the enhanced stellar winds, thereby significantly altering their atmospheric chemistry as well as causing a significant accretion luminosity during the epochs of most intense stellar mass loss. Future generations of infrared observatories might be able to probe the thermal and chemical structure of such hot Jupiters' atmospheres. Finally, we argue that, unlike their main-sequence analogs (whose zonal winds are thought to be organized in only a few broad, planetary-scale jets), red-giant hot Jupiters should have multiple, narrow jets of zonal winds and efficient day-night redistribution.},

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the Karhunen-Loève image projection algorithm) using synthetic circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time.

	abstract = {We describe a Bayesian rejection-sampling algorithm designed to efficiently compute posterior distributions of orbital elements for data covering short fractions of long-period exoplanet orbits. Our implementation of this method, Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI), converges up to several orders of magnitude faster than two implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in this regime. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach by showing that OFTI calculates accurate posteriors for all existing astrometry of the exoplanet 51 Eri b up to 100 times faster than a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. We demonstrate the accuracy of OFTI by comparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various MCMC implementations, finding the output posteriors to be identical within shot noise. We also describe how our algorithm was used to successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future based on less than three months of astrometry. Finally, we apply OFTI to 10 long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs, all but one of which have been monitored over less than 3\% of their orbits, producing fits to their orbits from astrometric records in the literature.},

These systems have survived, at least in part, through all stages of stellar evolution that precede the white dwarf. During the time interval ({\textasciitilde}200 million years) that a typical polluted white dwarf in our sample has been cooling it has accreted from its planetary system the mass of one of the largest asteroids in our solar system (e.g., Vesta or Ceres). Usually, this accreted mass will be only a fraction of the total mass of rocky material that orbits these white dwarfs; for plausible planetary system configurations we estimate that this total mass is likely to be at least equal to that of the Sun's asteroid belt, and perhaps much larger.

The spectroscopy shows eight to be DA white dwarfs, with six of these having high signal-to-noise ratio appropriate for our analysis. Two of these white dwarfs are consistent with singly evolved cluster membership, and both are high mass ∼1.07 M⊙, and give equivalent progenitor masses of 4.69 M⊙. To supplement these new high-mass white dwarfs and analyze the initial-final mass relation (IFMR), we also looked at 30 white dwarfs from publicly available data that are mostly all high-mass (≳ 0.9 M⊙). These original published data exhibited significant scatter, and to test if this scatter is true or simply the result of systematics, we have uniformly analyzed the white dwarf spectra and have adopted thorough photometric techniques to derive uniform cluster parameters for their parent clusters. The resulting IFMR scatter is significantly reduced, arguing that mass-loss rates are not stochastic in nature and that within the ranges of metallicity and mass analyzed in this work mass loss is not highly sensitive to variations in metallicity. Lastly, when adopting cluster ages based on Y2 isochrones, the slope of the high-mass IFMR remains steep and consistent with that found from intermediate-mass white dwarfs, giving a linear IFMR from progenitor masses between 3 and 6.5 M⊙. In contrast, when adopting the slightly younger cluster ages based on PARSEC isochrones, the high-mass IFMR has a moderate turnover near an initial mass of 4 M⊙. Based on observations with the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M.

	abstract = {We have completed a direct-imaging search for faint companions (FCs) to 23 stars within 13 pc of the Sun using the Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera. The strategy of this search changed considerably from that reported in 1996. To maximize the image contrast between potential FCs and a target star's point-spread function, we adopted the F1042M filter (λc{\textasciitilde}1.02 μm, Δλ{\textasciitilde}0.04 μm) as the primary bandpass of our search. Although our sensitivity to FCs varied with the brightness of and separation from our target stars, an ultimate 10 σ detection limit of m1042{\textasciitilde}18 within 17" of the fainter targets was achieved. As the end of the main sequence occurs at M1042{\textasciitilde}12, this detection limit makes our search for FCs to nearby stars the most sensitive yet published. Despite this great sensitivity, no previously undetected FCs were found. Our survey would have detected all stellar companions within 17" of our target stars, except for any lowest mass companions lying within 0.5"-1" of the brightest (V{\textless}1.5) targets. Applying recent models of brown dwarf spectra and evolution, we find that our search was sensitive to young (0.5 Gyr), low-mass (less than 10 MJ) brown dwarf companions to the fainter targets within 5 pc. A brown dwarf with mass 40 MJ and age 5 Gyr would have been detected at separations greater than 5" from Gl 559A (α Centauri A). Our search was not sensitive to 1 Gyr-old brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}5 MJ, nor was it sensitive to 5 Gyr-old brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 MJ. On the positive side, we show the first direct image of the triple system GJ 1245ABC in which all three components are well resolved. Multiband photometry of GJ 1245C suggests for that object a spectral type later than M7. The measured positions of GJ 1245AC are discordant with those expected from published photocentric-orbit elements. The observed positions of four other multiple systems (Gl 65AB, Gl 244AB, Gl 280AB, and Gl 866ABC) also differ from those expected from published orbital elements. The discrepancies noted for Gl 280AB are sufficient to resolve the long-standing inconsistency between Procyon's observed luminosity and that derived from the theoretical mass-luminosity relation. F1042M images of the astrometric binary Gl 105A do not reveal the presence of a fourth component, as has been proposed to reconcile the differences between the observed location of the M7 V companion Gl 105C and the predicted separations of the perturbing body from two independent astrometric studies.},

	abstract = {Planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star. However, an additional planetary formation route may exist in old evolved binary systems. In such systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where mass transferred from the expanding evolved star to its binary companion could form an accretion disk around it. Such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for, and/or interact with, the second generation planets, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions may serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including PSR B1620-26 (in a globular cluster), Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique configurations.},

	abstract = {We discuss the interior structure and composition of giant planets, and how this structure changes as these planets cool and contract over time. Here we define giant planets as those that have an observable hydrogen-helium envelope that includes Jupiter-like planets, which are predominantly H/He gas, and Neptune-like planets, which are predominantly composed of elements heavier than H/He. We describe the equations of state of planetary materials and the construction of static structural models and thermal evolution models. We apply these models to transiting planets close to their parent stars, as well as directly imaged planets far from their parent stars. Mechanisms that have been postulated to inflate the radii of close-in transiting planets are discussed. We also review knowledge gained from the study of the solar system's giant planets. The frontiers of giant planet physics are discussed with an eye toward future planetary discoveries.},

	abstract = {Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the Solar System1, most of which orbit stars that will eventually evolve into red giants and then into white dwarfs. During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will be engulfed by the star2, but more distant planets can survive this phase and remain in orbit around the white dwarf3,4. Some white dwarfs show evidence for rocky material floating in their atmospheres5, in warm debris disks6-9 or orbiting very closely10-12, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that were scattered inwards and tidally disrupted13. Recently, the discovery of a gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to that of ice giant planets14 demonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether these planets can survive the journey. So far, no intact planets have been detected in close orbits around white dwarfs. Here we report the observation of a giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4 days. We observed and modelled the periodic dimming of the white dwarf caused by the planet candidate passing in front of the star in its orbit. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more than 14 times as massive (with 95 per cent confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence of common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during the red giant phase and shrinks owing to friction. In this case, however, the long orbital period (compared with other white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions) and low mass of the planet candidate make common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, our findings for the WD 1856+534 system indicate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being tidally disrupted, motivating the search for smaller transiting planets around white dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} − G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}{\textless}A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia"{\textgreater}http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. A vortex coronagraph is now available for high contrast observations with the Keck/NIRC2 instrument at L band. The vortex coronagraph uses a vortex phase mask in a focal plane and a Lyot stop in a downstream pupil plane to provide high contrast at small angular separations from the observed host star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Reaching the optimal performance of the coronagraph requires fine control of the wavefront incident on the phase mask. In particular, centering errors can lead to significant stellar light leakage that degrades the contrast performance and prevents the observation of faint planetary companions around the observed stars. It is thus critical to correct for the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center, generally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity field variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil tracking mode. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex coronagraph has been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument. This algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center, and stabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: On-sky data show that the QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4 mas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator is probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot stop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5 mas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust method to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition, QACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the observing efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used for vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and angular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.},

	abstract = {We present a new set of solar metallicity atmosphere and evolutionary models for very cool brown dwarfs and self-luminous giant exoplanets, which we term ATMO 2020. Atmosphere models are generated with our state-of-the-art 1D radiative-convective equilibrium code ATMO, and are used as surface boundary conditions to calculate the interior structure and evolution of 0.001-0.075 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} objects. Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by {\textasciitilde}1-2\% at the stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams, highlighting how the 3.5-5.5 μm flux window can be used to calibrate vertical mixing in cool T-Y spectral type objects.},

	abstract = {We present the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) based on the self-consistent analysis of Sirius B and 79 white dwarfs from 13 star clusters. We have also acquired additional signal on eight white dwarfs previously analyzed in the NGC 2099 cluster field, four of which are consistent with membership. These re-observed white dwarfs have masses ranging from 0.72 to 0.97 M ⊙, with initial masses from 3.0 to 3.65 M ⊙, where the IFMR has an important change in slope that these new data help to observationally confirm. In total, this directly measured IFMR has small scatter (σ = 0.06 M ⊙) and spans from progenitors of 0.85 to 7.5 M ⊙. Applying two different stellar evolutionary models to infer two different sets of white dwarf progenitor masses shows that, when the same model is also used to derive the cluster ages, the resulting IFMR has weak sensitivity to the adopted model at all but the highest initial masses ({\textgreater}5.5 M ⊙). The nonlinearity of the IFMR is also clearly observed with moderate slopes at lower masses (0.08 M final/M initial) and higher masses (0.11 M final/M initial) that are broken up by a steep slope (0.19 M final/M initial) between progenitors from 2.85 to 3.6 M ⊙. This IFMR shows total stellar mass loss ranges from 33\% of M initial at 0.83 M ⊙ to 83\% of M initial at 7.5 M ⊙. Testing this total mass loss for dependence on progenitor metallicity, however, finds no detectable sensitivity across the moderate range of -0.15 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} +0.15.
