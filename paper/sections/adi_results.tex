The top-left frame is the collapsed residual frame, the top-right is the Gaussian S/N map, the bottom-left is the STIM probability map, and the bottom-right is the Student-t corrected significance map. In each frame the inner FWHM is masked out. The right figure show the Gaussian (solid line) and Student-t corrected (dashed curve) 5$\sigma$ contrast curve. Outputs for other epochs and other algorithms (21 figures) are in the online figure set and the GitHub repository.}
